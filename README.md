# GeenieEats App

## Inspiration
GeenieEats is working to address the rising issue of global food waste. Unsold food is getting wasted yet many people are struggling to afford food. Small businesses alone are struggling as more Than 3.3 Million Tonnes Of Food Waste From Hotels, Restaurants, Bars And Events Go Into Landfill Sites Every Year. Yet 1 in 8 households in North America is food insecure, amounting to more than 38.3 million people living in food-insecure households

## What it does
GeenieEats works to build these missing connections by connecting restaurants with customers to purchase food before it goes to waste.

This way businesses are able to make a profit on food that may have been wasted.
Customers are able to help their community, save money and make a positive impact on the environment.
How we built it
GeenieEats was built with React Native for the front end and Firebase for the backend.

##Challenges we ran into
Working with mobile development is difficult and time-consuming while trying to get simulators up and running. Although most of GeenieEats functionality is the common CRUD actions the most major issue we run into was the react useeffect cleanup error while pulling data from firebase. However, by watching youtube videos and reading articles we were able to get rid of most of the errors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Completing the applications core functionality
- All of the learning along the way 
- earned a lot about staying organized and planning before diving into the code. By identifying the core features of the GeenieEats app and designing a basic mock-up and having sample UI inspiration to follow we were able to complete the application in the allotted time frame.

Recognized the importance of getting features done rather than perfect. At first, we wanted to spend a lot of time revamping the UI but realized the core features were more important at times.

## What's next for GeenieEats
completing the dashboard
revamping the UI
integrating an AI-powered notification system and pricing system

# File Importance 
screens folder contains all of the pages and components used throuhgout the app. Containers such as the 'UsersHome', and 'CompanyHome' were used to differentiate between user types. All components used in containers such as the 'CompanyAddItemPage' and 'PastOrders' for the restaurant owners are located in the 'components folder'. 

All images are stored in the assets folder and future photos will be stored in the firebase server.
